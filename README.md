# Project-July - (DEV)
Game Streaming / Remote Desktop Software Suite
Project-July is a "Remote Desktop & Game Streaming" software suite is fully based on "Peer to Peer" communication. So the server is only required at the time of signaling. 🤝



What is Project-July ?

Project-July is similar to remote deskop application but it mainly focus on playing "PC Games on mobile" through "Web Browser (WebView)" and mainly this project is open source. 
Currently baisc functionalites were added to web application like Typewriting, Touch events and Minimal Virtual Joypad Controls.



How it works ?

--- Four major things are required for this project ---

July Software (To capture the screen and stream)

July Client (To control the remote PC where the stream is coming from)

July Server (A signaling server to establish a peer to peer communication)

July Agent (To create a pipeline between javascript & python to exchange the data)

Programming Languages Used : Javascript & Python



Will it works ?

Tested on "Redmi Note 9 Pro" Mobile (Edge Browser & React Native WebView).

Gameplay Test : I tried GTA 5 and its working good. But the key mapping is not fully completed. Soon the stable version source code will be released.
